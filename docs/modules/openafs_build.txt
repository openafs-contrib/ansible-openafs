> OPENAFS_BUILD    (/home/mmeffie/src/ansible-openafs/roles/openafs_devel/library/openafs_build.py)

        Build OpenAFS server and client binaries from source code. The source code must be already present in the `projectdir'
        directory on the host. The [openafs_build] module will run the OpenAFS `regen.sh' command, then run `configure' with
        the given `configure_options', and then run `make' with the given `target'. A complete set of build log files are
        written on the `logdir' directory on the host for build troubleshooting. Out-of-tree builds are supported by
        specifying a build directory with the `builddir' option. Before the build starts, `git clean' is run in the
        `projectdir' directory to remove all untracked files when `clean' is true and a `.git' directory is found in the
        `projectdir'. All of the files and directories are removed from the `builddir' when `clean' is true and an out-of-tree
        build is being done. A check for a loadable kernel module is done after the build completes when the `state' is
        `kernel_module_built'.  Be sure the `target' and `configure_options' are set to build a kernel module when using the
        `mkodready' state. An installation file tree is created in the `destdir' directory when the `target' starts with
        `install' or `dest'. The files in `destdir' may be installed with the [openafs_install] module. See the
        `openafs_devel' role for tasks to install required build tools and libraries on various platforms.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- builddir
        The path for out-of-tree builds.
        [Default: `projectdir']
        type: path

- clean
        Run `git clean' in the `projectdir' when it contains a `.git' directory.
        Remove the `builddir', if different than the `projectdir'.
        A `clean' build should be done if the source files in `projectdir' or the `configure_options' have been changed since
        the last time this module has been run.
        Use the `clean' option with caution!
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- configure_options
        The `configure' options, as a dictionary or string of configure command line arguments.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list

- destdir
        The destination directory for `install' and `dest' targets and variants.
        The tree staged in this directory may be installed with the [openafs_install] module.
        [Default: `projectdir'/packaging/dest]
        type: path

- jobs
        Number of parallel make processes.
        Set this to 0 to disable parallel make.
        [Default: the number of CPUs on the system]
        type: int

- logdir
        The path to store build log files.
        The logdir may be a subdirectory of the `projectdir'.
        The logdir may not be a subdirectory of the `builddir' when doing an out-of-tree build.
        [Default: `projectdir'/.ansible]
        type: path

- make
        The `make' program to be executed.
        [Default: detect]
        type: path

- manpages
        Generate the man-pages from POD files when running `regen'.
        [Default: True]
        type: bool

= projectdir
        The project directory.
        Source files must have been previously checkout or copied to this path.

        type: path

- state
        `built' Build completed
        `kernel_module_built' After the build is completed, verify a kernel module was built for the current running kernel
        version.
        (Choices: built, kernel_module_built)[Default: complete]
        type: str

- target
        The make target to be run.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- version
        Version string to embed in built files.
        The `version' will be written to the `.version' file, overwritting the current contents, if any.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str
