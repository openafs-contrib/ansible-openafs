# Install a prebuilt OpenAFS kernel module for the currently running kernel
# version. This install method requires a private zypper repo populated with
# OpenAFS packages and prebuilt kernel module rpm package files (openafs-kmp).
#
# Just installing the 'openafs-kmp' package will install a kernel module for
# the most recent kernel version in the zypper repository, not neccessarily the
# version currently running on the remote node. In order to obviate the need to
# update the kernel and endure a reboot when importing this role, we attempt to
# install the openafs-kmp with the full version name. This is a bit tricky
# since the full name also contains on the OpenAFS version name. First, we
# ensure the base openafs package is installed, and then query the version
# string from the installed base package. Then we use that version string plus
# the running kernel version to specify the full openafs-kmp package name.
