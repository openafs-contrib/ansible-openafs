# Install a prebuilt OpenAFS kernel module for the currently running kernel
# version. This install method requires a private yum repo populated with
# OpenAFS packages and prebuilt kernel module rpm package files (kmod-openafs).
#
# Just installing the 'kmod-openafs' package will install a kernel module for
# the most recent kernel version in the yum repository, not neccessarily the
# version currently running on the remote node. In order to obviate the need to
# update the kernel and endure a reboot when importing this role, we attempt to
# install the kmod-openafs with the full version name. This is a bit tricky
# since the full name also contains on the OpenAFS version name. First, we
# ensure the base openafs package is installed, and then query the version
# string from the installed base package. Then we use that version string plus
# the running kernel version to specify the full kmod-openafs package name.
