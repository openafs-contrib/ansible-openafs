# Install OpenAFS from source.

# The checkout method determines how the source code is retrieved for the build.
#
# We build both the server and client binaries (including the kernel module) if
# the node is both a client and a server. This is to avoid mismatch shared
# libraries and binaries, since this node is installed from source.
#
# Currently, we a are limited to systemd and do not support selinux enforcing
# mode when installing from source.
#
# The afs_configure_options host variable may be set to override the default
# configure options used in the build.

# Install tools first to ensure git is installed too.
