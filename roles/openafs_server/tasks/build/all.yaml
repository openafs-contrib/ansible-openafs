# Build (or rebuild) the userspace binaries and kernel module for
# a node that is both a server and a client.
#
# Unfortunately, it is not feasiable to manage the client and server binaries
# separately when the node is both a client and a server, since that can lead
# to mismatched shared libraries.  So, if this node is both a client and a
# server, build (or rebuild) everything, including the kernel module. The
# client role is must be imported after the server role, and will skip the
# build so we only build once on a given node.
